draggybits
==========

draggybits is a jquery plugin that makes your html elements draggable, minimizeable, exitable, abominable, etc.

it was originally coded by me (jenn) but then my bestie/work pal/spirit animal (nick) improved it greatly

it's poorly documented, though, but we'll get to it

stay cool
